\section{Design a secure service authorization with a workflow engine}\label{design}

- Present a design to implement authorization

\subsection{Process properties to be protected}\label{processPropertiesToBeProtected}
-discuss different elements of the process that can or should be protected based on the example Camunda.
Platform:
Process variables (read, update)
Allowed calls
Process definitions
Rolls for service tasks

\subsection{Define authorization}\label{defineAuthorization}
- Analyze concrete implementation rolls and layers for the identified resource above

\subsubsection{Layers of authorization}\label{layersOfAuthorization}
- Define which of the identified resource above can be protected by authorization on a higher level (like
for example a SSO server)
- Define the resource that needs to have authorization defined within the workflow engine:

\subsubsection{Life cycle and rolls for authorization}\label{lifeCycleAndRolls}
- Define where the authorization, that need to be defined in the workflowengine, can be set in the life
cycle of a workflow:
- Implementation phase: Groups of services with the same roll (e.g. a group where every service
can access the subscription with a defined prefix, like payment- ): Can be set in the process model,
needs to be set before deployment
- execution phase: UI were an administrator can set fain grained authorization, can be set and managed
after deployment as wel

\subsection{Implementation of design}\label{implementation}
