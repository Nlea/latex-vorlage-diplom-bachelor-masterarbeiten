\subsection{Analysis of security vulnerabilities}\label{analysisVulnerabilities}
- Identify the vulnerabilities and name the attack vectors
- Thread to confidentiality and integrity of process and process data

\subsection{Critical use cases}\label{criticalUseCases}
- In which use cases can the identified vulnerability lead to a risk
- Examples:
- 1.scenario: distributed micro service architecture with critical business process, like credit application
(one malicious services writes and reads data from another service )
- 2. scenario: Software as a Service: Multiple customers use the same workflow engine in the
cloud:tenant based: without authorization different clients could read and write to process variables
of different customers
